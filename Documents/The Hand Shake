The Hand Shake

The client opens a connection to a server where the server is listening on a port that supports TLS.

This is the initiation of the Hand Shake.

The Hand Shake is done in several steps whereby the client and server must be able to agree on several aspects to the setup
of a secure connection. Which means that upon verification of the server (or mutual verification), they will agree to use
a shared symmetric key with which to encrypt all subsequent messages between them.

What attributes must they agree upon?

1. TLS Protocol Version
a. Recommended version: 1.2 or 1.1
b. Note that 1.0 is NOT recommended, nor the earlier SSL versions such as SSLv3

2. Cypher Suite
a. Cipher Suite defines both a key exchange algorithm and a Cipher Spec
b. Cipher Spec is the choice of encryption algorithm and MAC algorithm
